Dependency issues are proving difficult to resolve. 

Pinecone and Langchain's wrapper for Pinecone seem to be incapatible, but I haven't fully investigated.

Chromadb works in Streamlit Cloud at version that requires other dependencies that won't work with openai.

This week's goal: deploy an image to Cloud Run and just suck up the cost.
